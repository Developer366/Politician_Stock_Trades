            <p>This web site purpose is to list the richest representatives and senators and show what stock trade they are doing so that the user may be able to copy their trades. It is known that politicians due to the Stock Act have to disclose their trades within a certain time period.

Nancy Pelosi is a well known example of insider trading and she has been getting away with it for a while now. </p>
